******DO Data Analysis in a Container with Python and Sweetviz******

https://analyticsindiamag.com/step-by-step-guide-to-data-analysis-using-sweetviz/

To create a ubuntu docker container:
https://www.makeuseof.com/run-ubuntu-as-docker-container/

Then, install python3

After, install sweetviz
https://github.com/fbdesignpro/sweetviz

Remember, that version is importing pandas and numpy with latest versions, and
it has incompatibilities. Must reinstall pandas to version:   1.5.3
and numpy to version: 1.23.1

>pip install numpy==1.23.1
>pip install pandas==1.5.1

To run the docker image in a container, and then use bash terminal 
to keep it open:
>docker run -ti --rm ubupy01 /bin/bash

Remember, docker will start and close any container if there is nothing to do. 
That is why you need to run it with the bash command at the end.
the -ti is for interactive mode, and the rm is to stop and remove the container
when we exit.

When entering in >python3, this is the commands to get a csv data file and 
do some analysis in the python image. 

Install sweetviz first, to do analysis and comparisons of datasets.

Then import it as a html and move the html to another container with nginx to
display the report.




import pandas as pd
penguins = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataprofessor/data/master/penguins_cleaned.csv')
x = penguins.drop('species', axis=1)
y = penguins['species']
import sweetviz as sv
analyze_report = sv.analyze(penguins)
analyze_report.show_html('analyze.html')


Finally, move the file from the container, to the host for display it on 
a browser:

docker cp e8d8cd38e2b7:/analyze.html analyze.html
