Develop a REST/JSON web API in Python or Java that accepts an array of numeric inputs and performs the following:
Finds the highest 3 numbers
Computes the square root of the sum of squares of the 3 highest numeric inputs. The following is an example input:
 
{
                “data”: [5,4,6,1]
}
 
The output expected would be:
{
                “output”: 8.77
}
 
Please use Maven to manage any dependencies if using Java. 
The code must make use of Python Lambda functions (https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/map_filter.html) 
or Java Streams to compute the result. We encourage you to use the Spring framework if using Java, 
particularly to accelerate the development time for the web api. Please include unit tests
